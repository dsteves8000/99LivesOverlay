# 99LivesOverlay
This is used as a customizable overlay to display current pace for obtaining lives. To compile and run this, make sure JNativeHook1.1 is running, this is necessary to allow background inputs like "1" "2" "3" "0" "9" to be pressed while running your broadcasting software in the foreground. When running the program, the text gets set to a file named Events.txt, which can be used as a text source in OBS (or whatever broadcasting software you use) and will update in real time.
